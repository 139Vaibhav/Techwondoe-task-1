# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the project

I have built a React page of Techwondoe (https://www.techwondoe.com/)  (home page only) where all the content (text and images) is coming from a headless CMS of my choice (I have used Contentful).

### Checklist

- [x] = Built the homepage of techwondoe (https://www.techwondoe.com/) in ReactJS

## Available Scripts

In order to run the project, Follow the following steps

### `step-1 : npm install`

Installs all the dependencies from package.json file

### `step-2 : npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
